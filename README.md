# Hidato

This project is an implementation of a Hidato-Sudoku solver using Haskell programming languaje.

## Starting 🚀

To use the project, clone it or download it to your local computer.

### Requirements 📋

It is necessary to have a Haskel's compiler and `cabal`. This proyect was developed using `ghc 8.0.2`. If you don't have any, type
the following command if you are under a linux environment:

```bash
apt-get install haskell-plataform
```

### Instalación 🔧

To install and setup the project, just open the console from the root location of the project and execute:

```bash
make install
```

To compile the project, execute:

```bash
make build
```

And to execute it, just type the following command:

```bash
make run
```

This commands assume that your Haskell installation count with the `cabal` program, if it is not the case you could change the `makefile` rules or execute the program manually.

The indications to give the program a Hidato to be solved or generate it, are shown in it, as well as examples.
